**Be aware that this project is still a work in progress and may not work properly yet!**

This is the 'The Fallen Empire Socket Server'. All the realtime informations, which are required for making everytime working so seamlessly and fluently together, are being processed by this piece of software. It used the [Node.js] JavaScript runtime and the [socket.io] realtime application server.

If something doesn't work right away or is delayed, this is probably where the error comes from.
