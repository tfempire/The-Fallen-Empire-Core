**Be aware that this project is still a work in progress and may not work properly yet!**

This is the 'The Fallen Empire Core'. All the realtime information, which is required for making everytime working so seamlessly and fluently together, is being processed by this piece of software. It uses a [Java implementation by mrniko] of the [socket.io] realtime application server and is responsible for monitoring and linking everything together.

If something doesn't work right away or is delayed, this is probably where the error comes from.
